# Linked List Implementation

This project implements a linked list data structure in Python, along with a driver program to demonstrate its functionality. The linked list is a fundamental data structure used in various algorithms and applications for efficient data storage and manipulation.

## Project Structure
- `linked_list.py`: Contains the core implementation of the linked list, including node creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
- `linked_list_driver.py`: A driver program that runs various operations on the linked list to demonstrate its usage and functionality.

## Features
- **Node Creation**: The linked list consists of nodes that store data and a reference to the next node.
- **Insertion**: You can insert nodes at different positions (e.g., at the head, tail, or in the middle).
- **Deletion**: Functions to delete nodes from the linked list.
- **Traversal**: Methods to traverse the linked list and display its elements.

## How to Run

1. **Run the Linked List Driver**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - To run the program and see the linked list in action, execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python linked_list_driver.py
     ```

2. **Modify and Test**:
   - You can modify the linked list operations in `linked_list.py` and rerun `linked_list_driver.py` to test new functionality or additional cases.
